    <p>When you've bought all the ingredients on our list. You can follow these simple steps to make the world's
        greatest lasagna:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes,
            tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water.</li>
        <li>Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a
            third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup
            Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to
            prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
